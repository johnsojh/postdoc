Sketch of Research Statement

1. Van der Waerden's Theorem
   - qualitative and quantitative aspects of Ramsey Theory
   - focus only on qualitative aspect
   - vdw
   - qualitative question motivated by vdw
   - teaser: it's possible to study these qualitative questions by studying 
      ultrafilters on N (in fact, it's an easy result that such qualitative questions are 
      equivalent to studying ultrafilters on N [HS, Theorem 5.7])

2. Ultrafilters on N

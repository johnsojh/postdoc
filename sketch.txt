1. Hindman's Theorem
   X In 1916 Schur proved blah
   X A generalization of Schur's Theorem was proved by several people:
   first by Richard Rado, Sanders, and then Folkman, there theorem
   says blah
   X Hindman proved a far ranging generalization of all of these
   results
	# FST
   X Hindman <--> idempotent ultrafilters

2. Ultafilters and Stone-Cech Compactification
   - def of ultrafilters
   - extending addition to $BN$
   - topologing Stone-Cech

3. Szemerdi's Theorem and ideals in the $BN$

1. Van der Waerden's Theorem
   X qualitative and quantitative aspects of Ramsey Theory
   X focus only on qualitative aspect
   X vdw
   - table of implications using VDW(A; r, k)
     VKD(A; r+1, k) --> VKD(A; r, k)
          |
	  v
     VKD(A;r+1,k-1) --> VKD(A; r, k-1)
   - qualitative question motivated by vdw
     # would like to have at least three of these questions
       (1) 
       (2)
       (3)
     # Perhaps I should use VDW_k(A)
   - teaser: it's possible to study these qualitative questions by studying 
      ultrafilters on N (in fact, it's an easy result that such qualitative questions are 
      equivalent to studying ultrafilters on N [HS, Theorem 5.7])

2. Ultrafilters on N

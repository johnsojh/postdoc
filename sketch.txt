Sketch of Research Statement

1. Van der Waerden's Theorem
   X qualitative and quantitative aspects of Ramsey Theory
   X focus only on qualitative aspect
   X vdw
   - qualitative question motivated by vdw
     # would like to have at least three of these questions
       (1) 
       (2)
       (3)
     # Perhaps I should use VDW_k(A)
   - teaser: it's possible to study these qualitative questions by studying 
      ultrafilters on N (in fact, it's an easy result that such qualitative questions are 
      equivalent to studying ultrafilters on N [HS, Theorem 5.7])

2. Ultrafilters on N

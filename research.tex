\section{Research Description}
\subsection{Hindman's Theorem}
Issai Schur, in \cite{Schur:1916fk}, proved one of the earliest
results in Ramsey Theory.
His theorem states that if the natural numbers are divided into
finitely many classes, then there exists natural numbers $x$ and $y$
such that $\{\,x, y, x+y\,\}$ is contained in one class.
Several decades later in \cite{Hindman:1974ys}, Neil Hindman proved a
strong generalization of Schur's Theorem.
(It's known that Hindman's Theorem is strictly stronger than Schur's
Theorem \cite[Theorems 16.28 and 16.29]{Hindman:1998fk}; moreover,
Hindman's Theorem can \textsl{not} be generalized to an uncountable
``index'' \cite{Milliken:1978fk}.)
\begin{fst}
  For all natural numbers $r$, if \/ $\bbN = \bigcup_{i=1}^r C_i$,
  then there exist $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, r\}$ and a sequence $\la x_n
  \ra_{n=1}^\infty$ in $\bbN$ such that
  \[
    \biggl\{\, \sum_{n \in F} x_n : \hbox{$\emptyset \ne F \subseteq
      \bbN$ is finite} \,\biggr\} \subseteq C_i.
  \]
\end{fst}

The original proof of this theorem uses a complicated combinatorial
argument. 
(However, Baumgartner gives a shorter and slightly easier
combinatorial proof in \cite{Baumgartner:1974uq}.)
Even before the first combinatorial proof was discovered, it was known
by Fred Galvin that an easy proof of Hindman's Theorem would follow
from the existence of an object called an idempotent ultrafilter.
Unfortunately lack of space prohibits us from expanding on the
interesting history of Hindman's Theorem; but, the interested reader
can find a brief summary in the notes section of \cite[Chapter
5]{Hindman:1998fk}.

This connection between Hindman's Theorem and idempotent ultrafilters
was one of the first of many interesting connections between Ramsey
Theory and ultrafilters.
Moreover, despite over thirty years of study there are still many
attractive open questions surrounding this connection. 
Before we can even state those particular questions that interest us,
we pause to give a brief outline of some basic results and
definitions. 

\subsection{Algebra in the Stone-\v{C}ech Compactification}
\begin{defn}
  \label{defn:uf}
  Let $\emptyset \ne p \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\bbN)$.
  We call $p$ an \textsl{ultrafilter on $\bbN$} if and only if it
  satisfies the following four properties:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[(1)] $\emptyset \not\in p$.
    \item[(2)] If $A$, $B \in p$, then $A \cap B \in p$.
    \item[(3)] If $A \in p$ and $A \subseteq B \subseteq \bbN$,
      then $B \in p$.
    \item[(4)] Let $r \in \bbN$ and for each $i \in \{1, 2,
      \ldots, r\}$ suppose we have $C_i \subseteq \bbN$. 
      If $\bigcup_{i=1}^r C_i \in p$, then there exists $i \in
      \{1, 2, \ldots, r\}$ such that $C_i \in p$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

It's easy to construct essentially trivial ultrafilters. 
For all $a \in \bbN$ put $e(a) = \{\, A \subseteq \bbN : a \in A
\,\}$.
Then a simple check shows that $e(a)$ is an ultrafilter on $\bbN$.
We call such ultrafilters \textsl{principal ultrafilters}. 
Ultrafilters that are not principal are called \textsl{nonprincipal
  ultrafilters}, and the existence of such ultrafilters follows from
Zorn's Lemma. 

Our next set of definitions will enable us to describe a topological
and algebraic structure on the collection of all ultrafilters on $\bbN$.
This will give the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of $\bbN$ the
structure of a compact Hausdorff right-topological semigroup. 
(We will explain what ``right-topological'' means shortly.)
\begin{defn}
  \label{defn:alg}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] $\beta\bbN = \{\, p \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\bbN) :
      \hbox{$p$ is an ultrafilter on
      $\bbN$} \,\}$.
    \item[(b)] For all $A \subseteq \bbN$, put $\overline{A} = \{\,
      p \in \beta\bbN : A \in p \,\}$.
    \item[(c)] For all $A \subseteq \bbN$ and $x \in \bbN$, put
      $-x+A = \{\, y \in \bbN : x+y \in A \,\}$.
    \item[(d)] For $p$, $q \in \beta\bbN$, put
      $p+q = \bigl\{\, A \subseteq \bbN : \{\, x \in \bbN : -x +A \in q
      \,\} \in p \,\bigr\}$.
    \item[(e)] We say $p \in \beta\bbN$ is an \textsl{idempotent
        (ultrafilter)} if  and only if $p + p = p$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

The collection $\{\, \overline{A} : A \subseteq \bbN \,\}$ is a
basis for a compact Hausdorff topology on $\beta\bbN$.
We identify $\bbN$ with the principal ultrafilters by the injective
function $a \mapsto e(a)$. 
Then with this topology $\beta\bbN$ is simply the Stone-\v{C}ech
compactification of $\bbN$. 
For all $p$, $q \in \beta\bbN$, the sum $p+q$ is an ultrafilter.
Moreover, $(\beta\bbN, +)$ is a semigroup where the addition on
$\beta\bbN$ is an extension of the usual addition on $\bbN$. 
The details behind these algebraic assertions can be found in
\cite[Chapter 4 Section 1]{Hindman:1998fk}.
(However it is somewhat disconcerting to learn that since $(\beta\bbN,
+)$ contains a copy of the free group on $2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$ generators
\cite[Corollary 7.36]{Hindman:1998fk}, $(\beta\bbN,+)$ is a ``highly''
noncommutative semigroup.)

We summarize our discussion by saying that $(\beta\bbN,
+)$ is a compact Hausdorff right-topological semigroup. 
The right-topological semigroup part means that for all $p \in
\beta\bbN$, the function $q \mapsto q+p$ is continuous.
It's a fact due to Robert Ellis \cite[Corollary 2.10]{Ellis:1969zr}
that every compact Hausdorff right-topological semigroup contains
idempotents. 
In the case of $\beta\bbN$, we have 
$2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$ idempotents \cite[Theorem 6.44]{Hindman:1998fk}. 

To demonstrate how all of this elaborate equipment can be put to use,
we give an easy proof of Schur's Theorem using an idempotent.
\begin{schur}
  For every natural number $r$, if  \/ $\bbN = \bigcup_{i=1}^r C_i$,
  then there exist $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, r\}$ and natural numbers
  $x$ and $y$ such that $\{\, x, y, x+y \,\} \subseteq C_i$.
\end{schur}
\begin{proof}
  Pick an idempotent $p$ in $\beta\bbN$.
  Since $\bigcup_{i=1}^r C_i = \bbN \in p$, by Definition
  \ref{defn:uf}(4) pick $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, r\}$ such that $C_i \in
  p$.
  Now by Definition \ref{defn:alg}(d) we have that $\{\, x \in \bbN :
  -x + C_i \in p \,\} \in p$; and, Definition \ref{defn:uf}(2) shows
  that $C_i \cap \{\, x \in \bbN : -x + C_i \in p \,\} \in p$.
  Hence we can pick $x \in C_i$ such that $-x + C_i \in p$. 
  Applying Definition \ref{defn:uf}(2) again yields $C_i \cap (-x +
  C_i) \in p$.
  Finally, we can pick $y \in C_i \cap (-x+C_i)$.
  Therefore we have $\{\, x, y, x+y \,\} \subseteq C_i$.
\end{proof}

It's possible to strengthen the conclusion of this theorem to show
that the set $\bigl\{\, \{x, y\} \subseteq \bbN : \{x, y, x+y\}
\subseteq C_i\,\bigr\}$ is infinite.
(This particular result can be derived easily by knowing that members
of nonprincipal ultrafilters are infinite, and idempotents in
$\beta\bbN$ are necessarily nonprincipal.)
Modifying the proof to produce Hindman's Theorem is mainly a matter of
formulating the right inductive hypothesis.
The interested reader can find the details in \cite[Theorem
5.8]{Hindman:1998fk}. 

Our final set of basic definitions we allow us to formulate another type
of important algebraic structure in $(\beta\bbN, +)$. 
\begin{defn}
  Given subsets $A$ and $B$ of $\beta\bbN$, we put $A + B = \{\, p+q :
  \hbox{$p \in A$ and $q \in B$} \,\}$.
  Let $\emptyset \ne I \subseteq \beta\bbN$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] $I$ is a \textsl{left ideal} if and only if
      $\beta\bbN + I \subseteq I$.
    \item[(b)] $I$ is a \textsl{right ideal} if and only if
      $I+\beta\bbN \subseteq I$.
    \item[(c)] $I$ is a \textsl{(two-sided) ideal} if and only if
      $I$ is both a left and right ideal.
    \item[(d)] $\bbN^* = \{\, p \in \beta\bbN : \hbox{$p$ is
        nonprincipal} \,\}$.
    \item[(e)] We let $K(\beta\bbN)$ represent the smallest ideal of
      $(\beta\bbN, +)$, that is, $K(\beta\bbN)$ is a two-sided ideal
      and it is contained in every ideal of $(\beta\bbN, +)$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

By \cite[Theorem 4.36]{Hindman:1998fk}, it's known that $\bbN^*$ is a
compact ideal; and by \cite[Theorem 4.36]{Hindman:1998fk}, it's known
that the smallest ideal $K(\beta\bbN)$ exists. 
(However, $K(\beta\bbN)$ is \textsl{not} closed. 
This fact follows from \cite[Theorem 4.4]{Hindman:1996uq}.)
The smallest ideal is one of the most well understood ideal in
$(\beta\bbN, +)$.
For instance, elements in $K(\beta\bbN)$ are, in a certain sense,
``close'' to being idempotents ultrafilters. 
(See for example \cite[Theorems 4.39 and 4.43]{Hindman:1998fk}.)
We introduce the smallest ideal because many of our open questions are
inspired by it's properties. 

\subsection{Open Questions}
While the smallest ideal has a central importance in $(\beta\bbN, +)$
from a certain point of view $c\ell\bigl(K(\beta\bbN)\bigr)$ is more
important than $K(\beta\bbN)$. 
For instance, $c\ell\bigl(K(\beta\bbN)\bigr)$ is contained in every
compact ideal of $(\beta\bbN, +)$. 
For mathematical reasons, that we will expanded on shortly, we will
let $\Delta_1$ denote $c\ell\bigl(K(\beta\bbN)\bigr)$. 
Since $\bbN^*$ is an ideal, it's easy to see that $\Delta_1 +
\bbN^*$ is also a right ideal.
By \cite[Theorem 2.19(a)]{Hindman:1998fk}, we have that
$c\ell\bigl(\Delta_1 + \bbN^*\bigr)$ is a two-sided ideal of
$(\beta\bbN, +)$.
An easy argument shows that $\Delta_1 = c\ell\bigl(\Delta_1 +
\bbN^*\bigr)$. 
This natural leads us to wonder which compact ideals of $(\beta\bbN,
+)$ have this ``fixed-point'' property?
More precisely, we ask the following question.
\begin{ques}
  Does there exists a compact ideal $I$ of $(\beta\bbN, +)$ such that
  $I \ne \Delta_1$ and $I = c\ell\bigl(I + \bbN^*)$? 
\end{ques}

Bartel Leendert van der Waerden, in \cite{Van-der-Waerden:1927fk},
proved that if the natural numbers are divided into finitely many
classes, then for every natural number $k$ at least one class contains
a $k$-term arithmetic progression.
Van der Waerden's proof was purely elementary, using only the
pigeonhole principle and induction. 
However, an easy proof using the algebraic structure of $\Delta_1$ is
also known (see \cite[Theorem 14.1 and Corollary 14.2]{Hindman:1998fk}).
Many decades later, Szemer\'{e}di proved a powerful generalization of van
der Waerden's Theorem in \cite{Szemeredi:1975uq}.
To state his theorem we define the \textsl{Banach density} of $A
\subseteq \bbN$ by
\begin{align*}
  d^*(A) &= \sup\bigl\{\, \alpha \in [0,1] : \hbox{for all $k \in
    \bbN$, there exist $n \ge k$ and $a \in \bbN$} \\
  &\hspace{5em}\hbox{such that $|A \cap \{\,a, a+1, \ldots,
    a+n-1\,\}| \ge \alpha\cdot n$} \,\bigr\}.
\end{align*}
\begin{sz}
  If $A \subseteq \bbN$, $d^*(A) > 0$, and $k$ is a natural number,
  then $A$ contains a $k$-term arithmetic progression. 
\end{sz}

Currently there is no known proof of Szemer\'{e}di's Theorem using the
algebraic structure of $(\beta\bbN, +)$. 
Such a proof, if it exists, would likely involve the need for more
detailed understanding of the algebraic structure of compact ideals. 
Therefore, an algebraic proof of Szemer\'{e}di's Theorem is likely to
be a very difficult problem. 
However, before Szemer\'{e}di proved his famous theorem, Roth in
\cite{Roth:1953fk} proved that if $A \subseteq \bbN$ and $d^*(A) > 0$,
then $A$ contains a 3-term arithmetic progression.
Therefore we propose the following (hopefully simpler) problem.
\begin{prob}
  Produce an algebraic proof of Roth's Theorem. 
  (By algebraic, we roughly mean a proof that mainly uses the
  algebraic structure $(\beta\bbN, +)$. 
\end{prob}

Of course it is not obvious that such a proof, even in principle,
exists.




\subsection{Questions inspired by Arithmetic Progressions} 

\subsection{Szemer\'{e}di's Theorem}
Bartel Leendert van der Waerden, in \cite{Van-der-Waerden:1927fk},
proved that if the natural numbers are divided into finitely many
classes, then for every natural number $k$ at least one class contains
a $k$-term arithmetic progression. 
For expository convenience we will call a subset of the natural
numbers that contains a $k$-term arithmetic progression a
\textsl{$AP_{k}$-set}.
In fact, using van der Waerden's Theorem and the pigeonhole principle
we can easily derive the superficially stronger statement that one
class is a $k$AP-set for every natural number $k$.
Almost a decade after van der Waerden published his proof, Erd\H{o}s
and Tur\'{a}n stated a conjecture in \cite{Erdos:1936fk} about a
generalization of van der Waerden's Theorem that continues to be the
source of vibrant research.

To state their conjecture we define the \textsl{upper (asymptotic)
  density} of $A \subseteq \bbN$ by 
  \[
    \overline{d}(A) = \limsup_{N\to\infty} \frac{|A \cap \{1, 2,
      \ldots, N\}|}{N}.
  \]
  \begin{sz}[Erd\H{o}s-Tur\'{a}n Conjecture]
    \label{sz:upperdensity}
    If $A \subseteq \bbN$ and $\overline{d}(A) > 0$, then $A$ is a
    $k$AP-set for every $k \in \bbN$.
  \end{sz}

The Erd\H{o}s-Tur\'{a}n Conjecture turned out to be both correct and a
hard problem; it was proved almost forty years later by Szemer\'{e}di in
\cite{Szemeredi:1975uq}. 
(If a set with positive upper density is divided into finitely many
classes, then at least one class has positive upper density.
Combining this fact with Szemer\'{e}di's Theorem gives us van der
Waerden's Theorem.)
Szemer\'{e}di's proof of his theorem uses an elementary, but
complicated, combinatorial argument. 
Shortly after this original proof, Furstenburg produced another proof
in \cite{Furstenberg:1977fk} that used Ergodic Theory. 

Furstenburg, for technical reasons, proved a slightly different form
of Szemer\'{e}di's Theorem. 
We choose to give this alternate form because their slight differences
will produce interesting algebraic consequences latter.
Define the \textsl{Banach density} of $A \subseteq \bbN$ by
  
  \begin{sz}[Alternate form]
    \label{sz:banach}
    If $A \subseteq \bbN$ and $d^*(A) > 0$, then $A$ is a $k$AP-set
    for every $k \in \bbN$.
  \end{sz}
It's a straightforward exercise to show that if $\overline{d}(A) > 0$,
then $d^*(A) > 0$.
Therefore given Theorem \ref{sz:banach} we can derive Theorem
\ref{sz:upperdensity}.
The fact that Theorem \ref{sz:upperdensity} can be derive Theorem
\ref{sz:banach} was proved by Hindman in \cite[Theorem
2.1]{Hindman:1982fk}.
Hence we are justified in calling both versions Szemer\'{e}di's
Theorem. 

After these two initial proofs, a number of different types of proofs
have been discovered. 
The two latest proofs have been produced by Ben Green and Terence Tao
in \cite{Green:2010uq} and the (online) polymath group in
\cite{Polymath:2010kx}. 
However, despite the great variety of proofs produced so far, their is
currently no known ``algebraic proof'' of Szemer\'{e}di's Theorem.
By an algebraic proof I mean a proof that uses nothing but the
algebraic structure of $(\beta\bbN, +)$. 

Of course it is not obvious that such a proof, even in principle,
exists.
But, in the next section we give two pieces of evidence that an
algebraic proof may exist. 

\subsection{Known Algebraic Information on  Szemer\'{e}di's Theorem}

  \begin{defn}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[(a)] $\mathcal{AP} = \{\, p \in \beta\bbN : \hbox{for all
          $A \in p$ $A$ contains a $k$-term arithmetic progression
          for every $k \in \bbN$} \,\}$.
      \item[(b)] $\Delta = \{\, p \in \beta\bbN : \hbox{for all $A \in
          p$, $\overline{d}(A) > 0$} \,\}$.
      \item[(c)] $\Delta^* = \{\, p \in \beta\bbN : \hbox{for all $A
          \in p$, $d^*(A) > 0$} \,\}$.
      \item[(d)] $\Delta_1 = \{\, p \in \beta\bbN : \hbox{for all $A
            \in p$, there exists $m \in \bbN$ such that
            $d^*(\bigcup_{n=1}^m -n+A) = 1$} \,\}$.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{defn}


\subsection{Algebraic Proof of Roth's Theorem}

  \begin{defn}
    For all $A \subseteq \bbN$, define the \textsl{upper asymptotic
      density} of $A$ by 
      \[
        \overline{d}(A) = \limsup_{N\to\infty} \frac{A \cap \{1, 2,
          \ldots, N\}}{N}.
      \]
  \end{defn}

Erd\H{o}s and Turan conjectured that if $\overline{d}(A) > 0$, then
$A$ contains a $k$-term arithmetic progression for every natural
number $k$.
Their conjecture turned out to be correct and was proved almost forty
years later by Szemer\'{e}di in \cite{Szemeredi:1975uq}. 
To state Szemer\'{e}di's Theorem in algebraic language we introduce
the following two definitions.
  \begin{defn}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[(a)] $\Delta = \{\, p \in \beta\bbN : \overline{d}(A) > 0
        \hbox{ for all } A \in p \,\}$.
      \item[(b)] $\mathcal{AP} = \{\, p \in \in \beta\bbN : \hbox{for
          all $A \in p$ } A \hbox{ contains a $k$-term arithmetic
          progression for every $k \in \bbN$} \,\}$.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{defn}

Two important results in Ramsey Theory are Szem\'{e}rdi's Theorem and
Roth's Theorem. 
To state these theorems we introduce the familiar notion of \textsl{upper
asymptotic density}
  \begin{defn}
    Given $A \subseteq \bbN$, define $\overline{d}(A) = \limsup_{N \to
      \infty} (A \cap \{1, 2, \ldots, N\})/ N$.
  \end{defn}
Szem\'{e}rdi's Theorem states that if $\overline{d}(A) > 0$, then $A$
contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. 
This particular theorem is hard to prove and has a long history. 
Van der Waerden proved $\la\hbox{blah}\ra$, then Erd\H{o}s and Turan
was interested in which ``size'' of guarantees the conclusion to van
der Waerden's Theorem, they correctly conjectured that if
$\overline{d}(A) >0$, then $A$ contains arbitrarily long arithmetic
progressions. 
The proof of this conjecture was not immediate put proceeded in
steps. 
The first big step was provided by Roth in \cite{Roth:1953fk}. 
In this paper he proved the following $\la\hbox{Roth's Theorem}\ra$.
Next Szem\'{e}rdi gave a combinatorial proof of $\la\hbox{Roth's
  Theorem}\ra$ and extended it to a 4-term arithmetic progression. 
Finally Szem\'{e}rdi was able to prove the full case in
\textsc{SzPaper}. 
Soon after another proof of Szem\'{e}rd's Theorem was provided by
Fursternburg in \textsc{ERTpaper} that used Ergodic Theory. 
Since then several more proofs of Szem\'{e}di's Theorem have appeared
\textsc{cite all of the various version included DHJ}. 
It's an empirical fact that most Ramsey Theory statements are either
about idempotents or ideals.
For instance, van \dots

\section{Research Summary}

\section{Research Description}
\subsection{Van der Waerden's Theorem}
The field of Ramsey Theory is broadly described as the study of large
mathematical structures that are preserved under finite partitions.
From the qualitative viewpoint, Ramsey Theorists investigate precisely which
structures are preserved, and how they are preserved, under
finite partitions.
Quantitatively however, the focus is on computing estimates on how ``large'' a
certain structure must be to achieve this preservation property. 
(Except in a few small cases, computing exactly how large a structure
must be is beyond current mathematical technology.)
These two synergistic strands form the guiding principle for most research
in Ramsey Theory.

Van der Waerden's Theorem is an early result
\cite{Van-der-Waerden:1927fk} in Ramsey Theory that
directly illustrates the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the
field. 
Like most important theorems, there are many equivalent ways to state
van der Waerden's Theorem.
We choose to give a formulation that is not traditional, but it has
the virtue of making the qualitative and quantitative aspects more
transparent. 

  \begin{vdw}
    For all $k$, $l \in \bbN$, there exists a natural number $W \in
    \bbN$ with the following property: 
      \begin{quote}
        If $A \subseteq \bbN$ contains a $W$-term arithmetic
        progression and $A = \bigcup_{i=1}^k C_i$, then there exist $i
        \in \{1, 2, \ldots, k \}$ and $a$, $d \in \bbN$ such that 
          \[
            \{\, a, a + d, \ldots, a +(l-1)d \,\} \subseteq C_i.
          \]
      \end{quote}
  \end{vdw}

In order words, given any partition, with at most $k$ cells, of a
sufficiently long arithmetic progression, at least one cell contains a
$l$-term arithmetic progression.
For this result, finite arithmetic progressions is the structure
that is preserved; and, the number $W$ is a measure of how large we
need our structure to be to induce this preservation property.

A bit of thought proves that show that any
natural number bigger than $W$ is sufficient to ensure that a
$l$-term arithmetic progression is preserved.
Using this small observation and the well-ordering principle for
natural numbers enables us to make the following (nonvacuous) definition

  \begin{defn}
    For $k$, $l \in \bbN$, the number $W(k,l) \in \bbN$ is the
    \textsl{van der Waerden number} if and only if it is the smallest
    number such that whenever $A \subseteq \bbN$ contains a $W(k,l)$-term
    arithmetic progression and $A = \bigcup_{i=1}^k C_i$, there exist
    $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$ and $a, d \in \bbN$ such that
      \[
        \{\, a, a+d, \ldots, a+(l-1)d \,\} \subseteq C_i.
      \]
  \end{defn}

  \begin{rmk}
    The attentive reader may have already noticed that
    although we have mentioned finite partitions we have written $A$
    as a finite union.
    Of course, a finite partition is not the same thing as a finite
    union; but, as a practical matter it often doesn't affect the
    truth of Ramsey Theoretic results if we conflate the two. 
    Therefore we follow the usual convention of writing finite
    partitions and finite unions without bothering to make a
    distinction between the two.
